/* INSTRUCTIONS
 *
 * Complete the exercises below.  For each "EXERCISE" comment, add
 * code immediately below the comment.
 *
 * Please see README.md for instructions, including compilation and testing.
 *
 * GRADING
 *
 * 1. Submissions MUST compile using SBT with UNCHANGED configuration and tests with no
 *    compilation errors.  Submissions with compilation errors will receive 0 points.
 *    Note that refactoring the code will cause the tests to fail.
 *
 * 2. You MUST NOT edit the SBT configuration and tests.  Altering it in your submission will
 *    result in 0 points for this assignment.
 *
 * 3. You MUST NOT use while loops or (re)assignment to variables (you can use "val" declarations,
 *    but not "var" declarations).  You must use recursion instead.
 *
 * 4. You may declare auxiliary functions if you like.
 *
 * SUBMISSION
 *
 * 1. Submit this file on D2L before the deadline.
 *
 * 2. Late submissions will not be permitted because solutions will be discussed in class.

  // EXERCISE 1: complete the following recursive definition of a "member" function
  // to check whether an element "a" is a member of a list of integers "xs".
  // Your implementation of "member" MUST be recursive and not use the builtin "contains" method from the List class.
  // EXAMPLES:
  // - member (5, List (4, 6, 8, 5)) == true
  // - member (3, List (4, 6, 8, 5)) == false
  def member(a: Int, xs: List[Int]): Boolean = {
    xs match {
      case Nil                 => false
      case y :: ys if (y == a) => true
      case y :: ys if (y != a) => member(a, ys)
    }
  }

  // EXERCISE 2: complete the following recursive definition of an "allEqual" function
  // to check whether all elements in a list of integers are equal.
  // EXAMPLES:
  // - allEqual (Nil) == true
  // - allEqual (List (5)) == true
  // - allEqual (List (5, 5, 5)) == true
  // - allEqual (List (6, 5, 5, 5)) == false
  // - allEqual (List (5, 5, 6, 5)) == false
  // - allEqual (List (5, 5, 5, 6)) == false
  def allEqual(xs: List[Int]): Boolean = {
    def aux(ys: List[Int], y: Int): Boolean = {
      ys match {
        case Nil                 => true
        case z :: zs if (z != y) => false
        case z :: zs if (z == y) => aux(zs, y)
      }
    }
    xs match {
      case Nil     => true
      case y :: ys => aux(ys, y)
    }
  }

  // EXERCISE 3: complete the definition of the following function that computes the length of
  // each String in a list, and returns the original Strings paired with their length.
  // For example:
  //
  //   stringLengths (List ("the", "rain")) == List (("the", 3), ("rain", 4))
  //
  // You must not use recursion directly in the function.  You can use the "map" method
  // of the List class.
  def stringLengths (xs:List[String]) : List[(String, Int)] = {
    xs.map ((s:String)=>(s, s.length))
  }

  // EXERCISE 4: complete the function definition for "delete1" that takes
  // an element "x" and a list "ys", then returns the list where any
  // occurrences of "x" in "ys" have been removed.  Your definition of
  // "delete1" MUST be recursive.
  // EXAMPLE:
  // - delete1 ("the", List ("the","the","was","a","product","of","the","1980s")) == List ("was","a","product","of","1980s")
  def delete1[X](x: X, ys: List[X]): List[X] = {
    ys match {
      case Nil => Nil
      case z::zs if (x!=z) => z::delete1(x, zs)
      case z::zs if (x==z) => delete1(x, zs)
    }
  }


  // EXERCISE 5: complete the function definition for "delete2" below.  It must
  // have the same behavior as "delete1".  It must be written using "for comprehensions"
  // and not use recursion explicitly.
  def delete2[X](x: X, ys: List[X]): List[X] = {
    for (y <- ys if (y!=x)) yield y
  }

  // EXERCISE 6: complete the function definition for "delete3" below.  It must
  // have the same behavior as "delete1".  It must be written using the
  // builtin "filter" method for Lists and not use recursion explicitly.
  def delete3[X](x: X, ys: List[X]): List[X] = {
    ys.filter(_!=x)
  }

  // EXERCISE 7: complete the function definition for "removeDupes1" below.
  // It takes a list as argument, then returns the same list with
  // consecutive duplicate elements compacted to a single element.
  // Duplicate elements that are separated by at least one distinct
  // element should be left alone.
  // EXAMPLE:
  // - removeDupes1 (List (1,1,2,3,3,3,4,4,5,6,7,7,8,9,2,2,2,9)) == List (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,2,9)
  def removeDupes1[X](xs: List[X]): List[X] = {
    def aux[X](ys: List[X], e:X): List[X] = {
      ys match {
        case Nil => Nil
        case z::zs if (z==e) => aux(zs, e)
        case z::zs if (z!=e) => z::aux(zs, z)
      }
    }
    xs match {
      case Nil => Nil
      case y::ys => y::aux(ys, y)
    }
  }



  // EXERCISE 8: write a function "removeDupes2" that behaves like "removeDupes1",
  // but also includes a count of the number of consecutive duplicate
  // elements in the original list (thus producing a simple run-length
  // encoding).  The counts are paired with each element in the output
  // list.
  // EXAMPLE:
  def removeDupes2 [X] (xs:List[X]) : List[(Int, X)] = {
	  def aux[X](ys: List[X], e:X, count:Int): List[(Int, X)] = {
		ys match {
		  case Nil => List((count, e))
		  case z::zs if (z==e) => aux(zs, e, count+1)
		  case z::zs if (z!=e) => (count, e)::aux(zs, z, 1)
		}
	  }
	  xs match {
		case Nil => Nil
		case y::ys => aux(ys, y, 1)
		}
  }



  // EXERCISE 9: complete the following definition of a function that splits a list
  // into a pair of two lists.  The offset for the the split position is given
  // by the Int argument.
  // The behavior is determined by:
  //
  //   for all n, xs:
  //     splitAt (n, xs) == (take (n, xs), drop (n, xs))
  //
  // Your definition of "splitAt" must be recursive and must not use "take" or "drop".
  //
  // Your definition of "splitAt" must only travere the list once.  So
  // you cannot define your own versions of "take"/"drop" and use them
  // (because that would entail one traversal of the list with "take"
  // and then a second traversal with "drop").
  def splitAt[X](n: Int, xs: List[X]): (List[X], List[X]) = {
    def aux(n:Int, ys:List[X], xs:List[X]) : (List[X], List[X]) = {
      if(n<=0) (ys, xs)
      else {
        xs match{
          case Nil => (ys, xs)
          case z::zs => aux(n-1, ys:::List(z), zs)
        }
      }
    }
    aux(n, Nil, xs)
  }


  // EXERCISE 10: complete the following definition of an "allDistinct" function that checks
  // whether all values in list are distinct.  You should use your "member" function defined earlier.
  // Your implementation must be recursive.
  // EXAMPLE:
  // - allDistinct (Nil) == true
  // - allDistinct (List (1,2,3,4,5)) == true
  // - allDistinct (List (1,2,3,4,5,1)) == false
  // - allDistinct (List (1,2,3,2,4,5)) == false
  def allDistinct(xs: List[Int]): Boolean = {
    xs match{
      case Nil => true
      case y::ys if (member(y, ys)) => false
      case y::ys => allDistinct(ys)
    }
  }
}
